## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

Dropdown menus and nav-links using React state

```js
const [showNav, setShowNav] = useState(false)
const [featuresExpanded, setFeaturesExpanded] = useState(false)
const [companyExpanded, setCompanyExpanded] = useState(false)
```

### Continued development

I want to continue build apps with React, big and small to get the needed experience.
